[This is the personal website and research blog](https://akmunk.github.io/akmunk/). 

I maintain my CV, bio, and publication list here. And I use it to post updates and take running notes about my research activities. 

The website is [built with Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and publishes the markdown files in my public Obsidian vault.
